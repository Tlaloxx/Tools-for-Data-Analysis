# ðŸŒ± GROWTH â€” Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Framework  
*By Tlaloc Alvarez*  

> ### How to Use This Framework  
> Follow the **GROWTH** steps sequentially to guide your exploratory data analysis from defining goals to sharing actionable insights. Start by clarifying your objective, review your dataset thoroughly, then optimize and clean your data using the **CLEAN** framework. Analyze the data deeply, visualize key findings clearly, and finish by reporting insights with recommendations. This ensures a structured, clear, and replicable workflow for any dataset.
