# ðŸŒ± GROWTH â€” Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Framework  
*By Tlaloc Alvarez*

> **How to Use This Framework** </p>
> The **GROWTH** framework is a step-by-step guide designed to help you carry out a complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), from understanding your objective to communicating actionable insights. Each letter in the word **GROWTH** represents a key stage in the process: Goal, Review, Optimize, Work, Tell, and Highlight. During the "Optimize" step, youâ€™ll use the **CLEAN** method to clean and prepare your data, ensuring it's accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis. This approach can be applied to any dataset and helps you maintain a structured, clear, and repeatable workflow. Think of it as growing a garden â€” you start with seeds (raw data) and nurture them through a thoughtful process until they bloom into valuable insights.

## G â€” Goal of the Analysis  
> Clarify what youâ€™re solving and why.

- Define the core question or problem  
- Understand the project's context and scope  
- Identify dataset(s) and data sources  
- List stakeholders and collaborators  
- Document goals and success criteria  

---

## R â€” Review the Data  
> Explore your data before making changes.

- Check dataset shape and types  
- Understand variable meanings  
- Preview sample values and detect patterns  
- Note early insights or concerns  

---

## O â€” Optimize the Data (CLEAN Framework)  
> Prepare your dataset using the **CLEAN** method:

- **C â€” Conceptualize**: Understand the structure and role of each variable  
- **L â€” Locate**: Find missing values, duplicates, irrelevant entries  
- **E â€” Evaluate**: Examine outliers and problematic records  
- **A â€” Augment**: Add new features, encode variables, transform values  
- **N â€” Note**: Document all changes for traceability  

---

## W â€” Work the Data  
> Analyze your data to uncover patterns and relationships.

- **Univariate**: Distributions, frequencies, averages  
- **Bivariate**: Correlations, comparisons, cross-tabs  
- **Multivariate**: Clusters, PCA, heatmaps  
- Run basic statistical tests as needed  

---

## T â€” Tell with Visuals  
> Communicate findings using clear visuals.

- Use appropriate charts (bar, line, scatter, map, etc.)  
- Build simple dashboards or filtered views  
- Highlight key insights with labels and color  
- Avoid clutter and keep visuals clean  

---

## H â€” Highlight Results  
> Share insights, conclusions, and next steps.

- Summarize key findings and their impact  
- Report tested hypotheses and results  
- Note limitations or risks  
- Suggest recommendations or follow-up actions  
- Organize files for reuse and sharing
