### How to Use This Framework

Follow the **GROWTH** steps in order to guide your exploratory data analysis from start to finish. Begin by clearly defining your goal, then review your data to understand its structure and quality. Next, optimize your dataset by cleaning and preparing it using the **CLEAN** method. Analyze the data thoroughly, visualize your insights clearly, and finally, highlight your key findings in a concise report. This structured approach helps ensure thoroughness, clarity, and actionable results for any data project.
