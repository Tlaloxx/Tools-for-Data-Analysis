# ðŸŒ± GROWTH â€” Framework for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) By Tlaloc Alvarez

A practical guide to help you move from defining your goal to presenting clear and useful insights.

---

### **G â€” Goal & Project Setup**

Clearly define the purpose of your analysis to keep focused throughout the process.

* What problem are you trying to solve or what questions do you want to answer?
* What is the project context?
* Which dataset(s) will you use and where do they come from?
* Who is involved in the project or are the key stakeholders?
* Document these points for alignment and reference.

---

### **R â€” Review the Data**

Before manipulating data, explore and understand its structure and content.

* Check dataset size (rows and columns).
* Review data types and what each column represents.
* Look at unique values, ranges, and initial rows to spot obvious patterns or issues.
* Assess initial quality (missing values, outliers, inconsistent formats).

---

### **O â€” Organize & Clean (CLEAN Framework)**

Prepare your data for reliable and effective analysis.

* **C:** Check for duplicates, irrelevant or sensitive data to remove or anonymize.
* **L:** Locate missing values and decide how to handle them (imputation, deletion, etc.).
* **E:** Examine outliers to find unusual values that might skew your results.
* **A:** Assure correct formats and data types (dates, numbers, text).
* **N:** New features: create useful variables through feature engineering (extract year, group categories, encode categorical variables).

---

### **W â€” Work the Data (Exploratory Analysis)**

Analyze the data to discover trends, relationships, and anomalies.

* **Univariate:** Study each variable on its own (distributions, frequencies, averages).
* **Bivariate:** Explore relationships between two variables (correlations, scatter plots, cross tables).
* **Multivariate:** Examine interactions among multiple variables (clustering, PCA, heatmaps).

---

### **T â€” Tell with Visuals**

Present your findings clearly and effectively using visuals.

* Choose suitable charts (bar, line, map, pie charts).
* Create simple dashboards with filters or slicers.
* Highlight key patterns or insights with labels, colors, or annotations.
* Keep the design clean and avoid visual clutter.

---

### **H â€” Highlight Insights & Report**

Share your conclusions and recommendations based on the analysis.

* Summarize key findings and their potential impact.
* Describe tested hypotheses and results.
* Point out limitations and risks of the analysis.
* Suggest next steps or actions.
* Organize files (data, scripts, reports) for easy replication and future reference.
